        <h1><b>Junk Mail Killer</b></h1>
        <b>General</b>
        <p>Application runs on background and monitors inbox folder of defined mail box. Junk mails are detected based on given keywords
        and mails are transferred to JUNK_MAIL_KILLER folder. This folder is automatically created by the app.</p>
        <p><b>NOTE! This is a demo version and so far tested only in Elisa/Saunalahti environment.</b></p>
        <b>Settings</b>
        <p>Here you can enter necessary data for the application to be able to contact your mail server. <br>You have to give the mail server name for the arriving mail, your user id
        (normally your email address) and your password. Also the frequency of how often mails are checked has to be given.
        <br>When you save your settings, application tests the connection and informs you if everything is OK. </p>
        <b>Keywords</b>
        <p>At this window you enter keywords for identifying junk mails. Application checks if some of the
        given keywords are found in mails in inbox folder. Keyword is checked from sender, subject and
        the actual body of the mail. Check is not case sensitive and keyword can be just a part of a word.
        <br>For example: if keyword is win, then mails containing words winner, wins, winter, twin etc. would be considered
        as junk mail.</p>
        <b>Running the program</b>
        <p>If your settings and keywords are OK, you are ready to start the actual junk mail monitoring.
        Monitoring is a background process, so you can leave it running and start using other apps in your
        Android device. <br>You can go back to JunkMailKiller user interface anytime and for example change keywords.
        Just restart the app to use new keywords.
